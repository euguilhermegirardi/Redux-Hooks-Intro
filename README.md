# Redux-Hooks-Intro

## About the exercise

- The **Redux-Intro** is a simple exercise built with [**_React Redux_**](https://react-redux.js.org/) that approaches the basics of Redux-Hooks.

## The functionality

This exercise has two buttons, one to increment and the other to decrement a counter.
- In the **store.js** you will find the reducers and store itself.
- And in the **App.js** you will see how the frontend call use the actions from the reducers using 'useSelector' and 'useDispatch'.
- The **store2.js** is just another example that is not being used in the application.
